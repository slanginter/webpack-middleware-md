### Chores

* **package:** Update to Jest 20 (#52) ([5ec728b](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-defaults/commit/5ec728b))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **package:** Jest v20.0.0 introduce several breaking changes
    the most notable is a move to a custom ( rewritten ) version of Jasmine 2.5.
    This is known to effect at minimum, the test suite for `css-loader/new-loader's parse.test.js`

- Forked Jasmine 2.5 into Jest's own test runner and rewrote large parts of Jasmine.
- Jest does not write new snapshots by default on CI.
- Moved the typescript parser from jest-editor-support into a separate jest-test-typescript-parser package.
- Replaced auto-loading of babel-polyfill with only regenerator-runtime, fixes a major memory leak.

See [Jest v20.0.0 Changelog](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#jest-2000) and migration paths.
